# SPACE-PORTAL

**space-portal** is a **gateway** server.
It sits between the Internet and the **space-base**s.
Traffic from the Internet is sent to a **space-portal** and it then sends it to whichever **space-portal** it was addressed to.
It hosts secure TLS certificates for HTTP servers on the **space-base**s.

It is part of a tool-set for **self-hosting** various software, daemons, and applications.
